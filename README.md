# 👋 Francesco's Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio website! This is where I showcase my projects, share some thoughts through quotes that inspire me, and provide ways to get in touch.

## 🌟 What's Inside

**Projects** - A collection of my work ranging from web applications to creative coding experiments. Each project includes live previews (when available) and details about the technologies used.

**Inspirations** - Quotes and ideas that shape my thinking.

**Contacts** - Multiple ways to reach me, whether for collaboration, questions, or just to say hello!

## 🛠 Built With

- **React** - For a modern, component-based UI
- **TypeScript** - Type safety and better development experience
- **Vite** - Lightning-fast build tool and dev server
- **CSS3** - Custom styling with glassmorphic effects and smooth animations
- **SVG Animations** - Fluid wave animations for visual appeal

## 🎨 Features

- **Responsive Design** - Looks great on desktop, tablet, and mobile
- **Smooth Navigation** - Quick-jump buttons to different sections
- **Live Previews** - See projects in action with embedded iframes
- **Modern Aesthetics** - Clean, professional design with subtle animations
- **Masonry Layout** - Projects flow naturally in a Pinterest-style cascade

## 🚀 Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Preview production build
npm run preview
```

## 📦 Deployment

This site automatically deploys to GitHub Pages using GitHub Actions. Every push to the main branch triggers a new deployment at [frephs.github.io](https://frephs.github.io).

## 💝 Acknowledgments

Built with care using modern web technologies. The wave animations add a touch of fluidity, while the glassmorphic design elements create depth without overwhelming the content.
